# A final word

Thank you for playing this 'game'. I really appreciate it and i am super proud of what i've achieved here regardless of where i place.

This was my first ever submission to the Ludum Dare 46 Compo! I previously submitted a game to the Jam in LD42 as part of a team; but this was the first time going solo! As per the Compo rule all assets were made by myself using the following tools:

* Unity for the engine
* Aseprite to create the pixel 'art'
* Bosca Ceoilâ€‹ to create the music
* Audacity (and my microphone)to create the sound effects.
* YouTube/Stack Overflow/Google for answers to my gamedev problems.

Finally i tracked what i spent time on. Here's a quick breakdown: Sleeping/Breaks (19hrs), Dev (9hrs), Graphics (7.5hrs), Sound (4hrs), Polishing (6hrs). Total (26.5hrs working).
